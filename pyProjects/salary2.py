def main():
    number = float(input("How much do you make an hour? "))
    salary = get_salary(number)
    taxes = get_tax
    gross = gross_salary
    print(f"You make ${gross} a year. ")

def get_salary(s):
   get_salary = s * 40 * 52
   return get_salary

def get_tax():
    get_tax = salary * .30
    return get_tax

def gross_salary():
    gross_salary =
    return gross_salary

main()
